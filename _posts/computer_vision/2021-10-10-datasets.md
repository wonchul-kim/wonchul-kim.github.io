* [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php) **(약 백만장)**
    it spans 1000 object classes and contains 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images and 100,000 test images. 

* ImageNet-real
    This dataset contains ILSVRC-2012 (ImageNet) validation images augmented with a new set of "Re-Assessed" (ReaL) labels from the ["Are we done with ImageNet"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07159). These labels are collected using the enhanced protocol, resulting in multi-label and more accurate annotations.

    Important note: about 3500 examples contain no label, these should be excluded from the averaging when computing the accuracy. One possible way of doing this is with the following NumPy code:
    
* ImageNet-21k **(약 천사백만장)**
    * [학습된 모델들](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ImageNet21K/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md)
    
* CIFAR
