# [Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07831)

**Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS)** aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. 

To leverage the built-in objectness of **query-based transformers**, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. 

This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity
and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these,
we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS,
a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is
to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring “perfect alignment” to preserve objectness, while
simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in
selection and an innovative “visual query”-based replay
mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various
segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders
