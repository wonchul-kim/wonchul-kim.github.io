# [Improving Shift Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks with Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07410)


## Abs.

- downsampling operators in their pooling layers which have been observed to be sensitive to pixel-level shift, affecting the robustness of CNNs.

- We study shift invariance through the lens of maximumsampling bias (MSB) and find MSB to be negatively correlated with shift invariance. 

> MSB ???

- we propose a learnable pooling operator called Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling (TIPS) to reduce MSB and
learn translation-invariant representations.


## Intro.

> shift-invariant vision models to be more robust on out-of-distribution testing and adversarial attacks 

> observe a strong negative correlation between MSB and shift invariance, i.e. models with higher MSB are the least shift invariant


- We introduce two loss functions: $L_{FM}$ – to discourage known failure modes of shift invariance and $L_{undo}$ – to learn to undo standard shift
