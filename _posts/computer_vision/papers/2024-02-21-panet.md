### Bottom-up Path Augmentation

- `low-level feature`를 `high-level`로 전달하기 위해 제안



## Abstract

- `propose PANet aiming at boosting information flow in proposal-based instance segmentation framework.`
- `enhance the entire feature hierarchy with accurate localization signals in lower layers by bottom-up path augmentation, which shortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature.` 
- `present adaptive feature pooling, which links feature grid and all feature levels to make useful information in each feature level propagate directly to following proposal subnetworks.` 
- `A complementary branch capturing different views for each proposal is created to further improve mask prediction`

## Introduction

- `Instance segmentation aims to predict class label and pixelwise instance mask to localize varying numbers of instances presented in images.`

- [feature pyramid network (FPN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144.pdf)

- `COCO [37] consists of 200k images. Lots of instances with complex spatial layout are captured in each image.`
- `Differently, Cityscapes [7] and MVD [45] provide street scenes with a large number of traffic participants in each image. Blur, heavy occlusion and extremely small instances appear in these datasets.`

- `Densely connected convolutional networks`

- `features in low levels are helpful for large instance identification`
    - `But there is a long path from low-level structure to topmost features, increasing difficulty to access accurate localization information`

- `each proposal is predicted based on feature grids pooled from one feature level, which is assigned heuristically.`
    - `This process can be updated since information discarded in other levels may be helpful for final prediction`

- `mask prediction is made on a single view, losing the chance to gather more diverse information.`

1. `to shorten information path and enhance feature pyramid with accurate localization signals existing in low-levels, bottom-up path augmentation is created.`
    - This propagets low-level features enhance the entire feature hierarchy

2. `to recover broken information path between each proposal and all feature levels, we develop adaptive feature pooling.`
    - `It is a simple component to aggregate features from all feature levels for each proposal, avoiding arbitrarily assigned results.`
    - `With this operation, cleaner paths are created`

3. `to capture different views of each proposal, we augment mask prediction with tiny fully-connected (fc) layers, which possess complementary properties to FCN originally used by Mask R-CNN.`
    - `By fusing predictions from these two views, information diversity increases and masks with better quality are produced.`
