# [Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06278)

- semantic segmentation: per-pixel classification 
- instance segmentation: mask classification

The bottom line is that **mask classification can handle both of semantic and instance segmentation.** The mask classification predicts a set of binary masks and each of them is associated with a sling global class label prediction.
