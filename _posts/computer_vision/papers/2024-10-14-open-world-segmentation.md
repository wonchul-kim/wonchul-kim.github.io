title: Open-World Semantic Segmentation Including Class Similarity
category: Computer Vision
tag: [open-world segmentation]
---

This paper investigates the problem of open-world semantic segmentation. Given an image at test time, we aim
to have a model that is able to detect any pixel that belongs to a category that was unseen at training time and is
also able to distinguish between different new categories.
The first problem is called anomaly segmentation [9] and
aims to achieve a binary segmentation between known and
unknown. The second problem, called novel class discovery [21], aims to obtain a pixel-wise classification of novel
samples into different classes starting from the knowledge
of previously seen, labeled samples.

The aim of semantic segmentation is to predict a categorical distribution over  classes for all pixels in an image.
