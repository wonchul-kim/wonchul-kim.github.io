### Factors that hinder repeatability in deep learning

- Translation 

    - `shift equivalence` in deep learning

    - **CNN**은 `shift equivalence`에 취약함
        - stride가 2 이상인 pooling이나 convolution에 의해서 위치 정보가 손실
        - nonlinear activation에 의해서 입력에서의 위치가 변하면 완전히 다른 출력을 생성할 수 있음
        - interpolation, upsampling, 특히 bilinear 등은 위치 정합성을 보장하지 않음
        - aliasing으로 인해서 고주파수 정보가 손실될 수 있음

- Color

    - `robustness to appearance varations`
    
    - `generalization to pertuabations`

    - `invaraince to illumination`

- Noise


### Measurements

- Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)

    - has several limitations to consider when interpreting its results.

- Surface Dice coefficient (SDC)

- Hausdorf distance (HD)

- Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)

- Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
