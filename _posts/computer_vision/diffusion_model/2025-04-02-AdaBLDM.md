# [A Novel Approach to Industrial Defect Generation through Blended Latent Diffusion Model with Online Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19330)

- Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM)
- Blended Latent Diffusion Model (BLDM)
    - `defect trimap` to delinate the defective regions on the generated image
    - a cascaded `editing stage` at both the latent and pixel space
    - `online adaptiation` of the image encoder to refine the quality of the generated images

> AD metrics: \
    - AP: Precision-Recall 곡선의 AUC, anomaly를 얼마나 잘 탐지하는지 평가\
    - IAP: 개별 anomaly object 기준으로 계산한 AP, anomaly object 단위 평가\
    - IAP90: Recall 90%에서의 precision 측정, anomaly를 놓치지 않으면서 precision을 평가
