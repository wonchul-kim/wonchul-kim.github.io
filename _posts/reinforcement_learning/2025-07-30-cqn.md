#### Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning (CRL)

a framework that trains RL agents to zoom-into a continuous action space in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the use
of stable, sample-efficient value-based RL algorithms for fine-grained continuous control tasks.

* Iterates the procedure of 
    * discretizing the continuous action space into multiple intervals and
    * selecting the intervals with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level
* Coarse-to-fine Q-Network (CQN)
* robustly learns to solve real-world manipulation tasks within a few minutes of online training


## Introduction

* Continuous control domain에 있어서 Actor-critic algorithm이 기반을 잡았지만, actor와 critic network가 서로 복잡한 관여하는 부분이 많이짐에 따라 불안정한 학습을 보임

* 개념적으로 value-based RL algorithm은 critic network만 사용하는 것이기 때문에 더 안정적으로 학습이 가능

    * 하지만, action space가 discrete이기 때문에 단순 적용은 불가능

    * continuous action space를 여러 interval로 이산화하면 value-based RL algorithm이 적용될 수 있다는 연구가 진행됨

    * 이 때, discretization scheme에 따라 precision of actions and sample-efficiency간의 trade-off가 문제가 됨

        * 더 세밀한 이산화일수록 정확하지만 데이터가 많아짐



## Method

*  기존의 **CRL**은 single level에서 여러 bins로 이산화를 진행했지만, 본 논문에서는 여러 레벨에서 단계적으로 bin의 갯수를 늘리면서 진행


#### Inputs and ecoder

* **Inputs**: $\mathbf{o}_t$ consisting of
    
    * pixel observations $(\mathbf{o}_t^{v_1}, ..., \mathbf{o}_t^{v_V} )$ captured from viewpoints $(v_1, ..., v_V)$ 
    
    * low-dimensional proprioceptive states $\mathbf{o}_t^{\text{low}}$. 
    
* **Encoder**: lightweight 4-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) $f_\theta^{\text{enc}}$

    * encode pixels $\mathbf{o}_t^{v_i}$ into visual features $\mathbf{h}_t^{v_i}$, i.e., $\mathbf{h}_t^{v_i} = f_\theta^{\text{enc}}(\mathbf{o}_t^{v_i})$. 
    
    * To fuse information from view-wise features, we concatenate features from all viewpoints and project them into low-dimensional features. Then we concatenate fused features with proprioceptive states $\mathbf{o}_t^{\text{low}}$ to construct features $\mathbf{h}_t$.

#### Coarse-to-fine critic architecture

* $a_t^{l, n}$: an action at level $l$ and action dimension $n$ (e.g., delta angle for $n$-th joint of a robotic arm)

* $\mathbf{a}_t^l = (a_t^{l, 1}, \ldots, a_t^{l, N})$: an action at level $l$ where $\mathbf{a}_t^0$ is defined as a zero action vector

* coarse-to-fine critic to consist of individual Q-networks at level $l$ and action dimension $n$ as below:
$$
    Q^{l, n}_\theta(h_t, a_t^{l, n}, \mathbf{a}_t^{l-1}) \quad\text{for}\ n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}\ \text{and}\ l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}
$$

* Q-network takes $\mathbf{a}_t^{l-1}$, \textit{i.e.}, actions from all dimensions at previous level, to enable each Q-network to be aware of other networks’ decisions at the previous level

* design critic to share most of parameters for all levels and dimensions by sharing linear layers except the last linear layer, and making Q-networks take one-hot level index as inputs


#### Inference procedure



#### Q-learning objective

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RL}}^{l, n} = \left( Q_{\theta}^{l, n}(\mathbf{h}_t, a_t^{l, n}, \mathbf{a}_t^{l-1}) - r_{t+1} - \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\overline{\theta}}^{l, n}( \mathbf{h}_{t+1}, a', \pi^{l-1}(\mathbf{h}_{t+1}) ) \right)^2
$$

where $\overline{\theta}$ are delayed critic parameters updated with Polyak averaging~\cite{44} and $\pi^l$ is a policy that outputs the action $a_t^l$ at each level $l$ via the inference steps with our critic, i.e., $\pi^l(\mathbf{h}_t) = a_t^l$.


#### Implementation and training details

* the 2-layer dueling network [45] and a distributional critic [46] with 51 atoms

* use layer normalization [48] with SiLUactivation [49] for every linear and convolutional layers

* use AdamW optimizer [50] with weight decay of 0.1 

* Following prior work that learn from offline data [52, 53], we sample minibatches of size 256 each from the online replay buffer and the demonstration replay buffer, resulting in a total batch size of 512
