* library containing a sample efficient off-policy deep RL method, together with methods for computing rewards and resetting the environment, a high-quality controller for a widely-adopted robot, and a number of challenging example tasks

## 4. Sample Efficient Robotic Reinforcement Learning in the Real-World

#### Core reinforcement learning algorithm: **RLPD**



#### Reward functions: binary classifier, **VICE**, custom

#### Resets: forward-backward architecture
