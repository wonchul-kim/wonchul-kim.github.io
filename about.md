I completed a BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Yonsei University and received a MSc from the <a href="https://icsl.snu.ac.kr" target="_blank">Intelligent Control System Lab (ICSL) </a> in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Seoul National University, South Korea. <br/>
<br/>
During the MSc, my thesis advisor was <a href="http://aerospace.snu.ac.kr/about/faculty?mode=view&profidx=9" target="_blank">H. Jin Kim</a> and I was interested in the intersection between control and machine learning with the aim of building an intelligent control system to enable a robot to complete complex task autonomously. Thus, I basically focused on control theory and, robust and fast optimization to control a robot. (Application of my work included robot arms, vehicles, and multi-rotors.) However, considering the real world such as uncertain environments, the robots should require nonlinear predictive control, probabilistic decision making, and robust optimization. Thus, I tried to apply machine learning such as Gaussian Process and Reinforcement Learning for decision makings and modeling. Additionally, the safety must be considered in uncertain real-world environments. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am studying about deep learning for computer vision and natural language process.
